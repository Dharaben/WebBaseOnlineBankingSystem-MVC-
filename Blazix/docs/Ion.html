<h2>
Interfaces Over the Net (ION)</h2>

<h3>
Overview</h3>
ION is a technology for distributed processing over the net.&nbsp; ION
is based on Java interfaces.&nbsp; The sever implements a particular Java
interface and the client looks up the interface and uses it -- that's all
there is to it!&nbsp; The server can also make callbacks to the client
side via "callback interface"s.
<p>ION differs from earlier technologies such as RMI and EJB in its extreme
simplicity, and in the ability to easily make callbacks to the client.&nbsp;
Complementing the rather heavyweight technologies such as RMI and EJB,
the lightweight ION helps make a complete spectrum of distributed processing
technologies available for Java designers.
<p>ION technical details are given below.&nbsp; An easy step-by-step <a href="IonTut.html">ION
tutorial</a> is also included.
<h3>
ION steps</h3>
The first step is to define the interface that the server will provide,
and that the client will look up.&nbsp; The&nbsp; interface can be any
user defined interface, with the restriction that all argument and return
types must either be primitive Java objects, or they must be serializable.
<p>Once the interface has been defined and compiled and is available in
the client and server class paths, the further steps are:
<ul>
<li>
Register the interface at the web-server.</li>

<li>
Write a class that implements the interface.</li>

<li>
Configure this class in the web configuration file (web.ini) of the target
computer.</li>

<li>
Lookup the interface from the client and use it.</li>
</ul>
The server can also make callbacks to the client.&nbsp; For instance, the
client may ask the server to call a method at the client side whenever
some data item changes.&nbsp; Or the client may ask for a status via a
callback every minute.
<p>For callbacks, a second interface is used.&nbsp; This interface is also
registered at the web-server.&nbsp; But it is implemented by the client
rather than by the server.&nbsp; When the client performs the lookup for
the server-interface, the client also has the opportunity to specify the
callback interface.
<p>Multiple threads may be used by looking up the server-instance in each
thread.&nbsp; However, within each thread, all method calls are sequential.&nbsp;
When the client calls the server, the client is blocked until the call
completes.&nbsp; If the server makes callbacks, the original client call
is still blocked, though the client thread executes again to service the
callbacks.&nbsp; (Within the callbacks, the client is also allowed to make
other server calls.)
<p>ION callbacks are never server initiated.&nbsp; The server can only
make callbacks when it is in the middle of processing a client call.
<h3>
An example ION session</h3>
As a very simple example, an interface to have a factorial computed at
a remote machine may look like this:
<p><tt>package compute;</tt>
<br><tt>public interface Factorial {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int computeFactorial( int n );</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>At the server side, an object is registered that can compute the factorial.&nbsp;
When a client looks up the <tt>Factorial</tt> interface and makes method
calls, this registered object will be given those method calls.
<h3>
ION Client</h3>
The ION client needs to lookup an interface at a remote machine.&nbsp;
This is done by calling the method "<tt>lookup</tt>" in the "Ion" class,
with the remote host's name and the interface that is needed.
<br>A sample ION client program segment may look like
<p><tt>import desisoft.dsap.*;</tt>
<br><tt>import compute.Factorial;</tt>
<p><tt>// ...</tt>
<br><tt>Ion ion = new Ion();</tt>
<br><tt>compute.Factorial fact = (compute.Factorial)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ion.lookup( "www.myserverhost.com",
compute.Factorial.class );</tt>
<br><tt>System.out.println( "Factorial 3 = " +</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fact.computeFactorial( 3 ));</tt>
<br><tt>System.out.println( "Factorial 4 = " +</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fact.computeFactorial( 4 ));</tt>
<br><tt>// ...</tt>
<p><tt>ion.close();</tt>
<p>Here the client looks up an implementation of "<tt>compute.Factorial</tt>"
interface at the remote host "<tt>www.myserverhost.com</tt>".&nbsp; Assuming
a server class has been registered at <tt>www.myserverhost.com</tt> that
implements this interface, the client will get an interface object.&nbsp;
The client then uses this interface object to execute its methods.&nbsp;
The methods will actually run at "<tt>www.myserverhost.com</tt>".
<p>When done, the client closes the connection by calling "<tt>close</tt>".
<p>The methods needed by ION at the client side are in the <a href="IonClass.html">Ion
class</a>.&nbsp; For using ION over SSL, the Ion class is replaced by its
derived class IonSsl.
<h3>
ION Server class implementation</h3>
The ION server class is a class that implements a given serve interface.&nbsp;
A sample server implementation is
<p>package mypackage;
<br><tt>import compute.Factorial;</tt>
<p><tt>public class MyServer implements Factorial {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int computeFactorial( int n )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int result = 1;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( int i = 2; i &lt;
n; i++ )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
result = result * i;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return result;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<h3>
Registering the Interfaces</h3>
All interfaces used in ION need to be registered at the server.&nbsp; This
includes both the server and any callback interfaces.&nbsp; To register
an interface,&nbsp; run the tool "<tt><a href="Tools.html#blxionreg">blxionreg</a></tt>"
with the name of the given interface as the argument.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blxionreg compute.Factor</tt>
<p>Every time an interface changes, it must be re-registered.
<p>Once an interface is registered at the server, it may be used either
as a server interface or a callback interface.&nbsp; Registration is only
for the server side, clients do not need to register anything.
<h3>
Configuring the Server Class</h3>
An ION server class implements a server interface for access by clients.&nbsp;
All server classes must be configured in the web initialization file, as
shown in the following example:
<ol><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ion.name:&nbsp; MyIonServer</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ion.MyIonServer.className: mypackage.MyServer</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ion.MyIonServer.interface: compute.Factorial</tt></ol>
The above lines are configuing the class "<tt>mypackage.MyServe</tt>r".&nbsp;
The <tt>mypackage.MyServer</tt> class must implement the (registered) interface
"<tt>compute.Factorial</tt>".&nbsp;
<p>In addition, the server class may be configured with a callback interface.&nbsp;
A callback interface may be "<tt>nullable</tt>", in which case the client
can pass a null instead of a callback object (if the client is not interested
in receiving callbacks.)&nbsp; If the server is configured to accept nullable
callback interfaces, it must check to make sure the interface object is
not null before it makes client callbacks.
<p>If the server is configured for callbacks, or if the server is interested
in "connection start" and "connection closed" events, or if the server
wants to be able to disconnect the call, the server also implements the
optional interface "<a href="IonServer.html">Ion<tt>Server</tt></a>".&nbsp;
This interface provides the server object with a callback interface object,
and lets it know when the connection is started or closed.
<h3>
ION Callback processing</h3>
During processing an ION call, the server can make a "callback" over a
callback interface.&nbsp; At this point, the server processing stops, and
the processing continues at the client side.&nbsp; The client side may
simply return from the callback, or it may make other server calls before
finally returning.&nbsp; The server side may make more than one callbacks.&nbsp;
After all the callbacks have finally returned, the original client call
finally returns.&nbsp; The image below shows a simple ION call, and an
ION call with one simple callback.
<br><img SRC="IonCalls.gif" >
<h3>
Other Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The ION interface and any classes it requires must be available and in
the classpath, at both the client and the server.&nbsp; This includes "<tt>blazix.jar</tt>".</li>

<li>
The HTTP protocol is request-response oriented, and is not designed for
continuous communication.&nbsp; ION&nbsp; is implemented using the <a href="Dsap.html">DSAP</a>
protocol.&nbsp; The DSAP protocol -- and therefore ION -- is only available
in Blazix if Blazix is being used directly as a web-server, and not if
it is being used as a Java-processing back-end for another front-end sever
(because the front-end servers are limited to request-response and cannot
provide continuous communication.)&nbsp; In practice this should not be
a significant restriction because Blazix happens to be efficient enough
that it can serve very high volume sites without needing a front-end C++
server.</li>
