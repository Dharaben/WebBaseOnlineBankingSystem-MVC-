<h2>
Setting up an SSL (https) server</h2>
Blazix can be set up to provide SSL services.
<p>SSL services requires the JSSE software.&nbsp; This is included in Java 1.4 (or above.)
But if you have an earlier version of Java and if do not already
have <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">JSSE</a> installed, download
and extract it, and make sure to place jcert.jar, jnet.jar and jsse.jar
either in your classpath or as installed extensions.
<p>To enable SSL, add the following lines to the web-server configuration
file:
<p><b>ssl.port</b>&nbsp; This should be set to the port number where the
HTTPS server will run.&nbsp; The default port for HTTPS server is port
443 (like the default port for the HTTP server is 80.)
<p><b>ssl.share</b>&nbsp; This should be set to a number between 1 and
100.&nbsp; This indicates what percentge of resources Blazix should allocate
to HTTPS versus to normal HTTP.&nbsp; Setting this to 100 will disable
the HTTP server and only run the HTTPS server.&nbsp; Setting this to 50
will allocate resources evenly.&nbsp; If you expect that except for an
initial login, all the site will be running HTTPS, use a high number like
80 or 90.&nbsp; If HTTPS will only be used for some processing and most
of the site will use HTTP, use a low number like 10 or 20.
<p><b>ssl.keystore&nbsp;</b> This should be set to the path of the<a href="#keystore">
keystore</a> file.
<p><b>ssl.keystorePassword</b>&nbsp; This should be set to the keystore
password.&nbsp; This might be omitted, but in that case the Blazix server
will require that the password be manually input during startup.&nbsp;
If running the web-server as an NT service or from a Unix RC file, the
password must be provided, because manual entry is not available.
<p><b>ssl.showPasswordDialog</b>&nbsp; If ssl.keystorePassword is not specified,
normally Blazix will ask for password on the command window, and the password
will be echoed.&nbsp; To prevent echoing of password, set this to true.&nbsp;
An AWT dialog will be presented with appropriate password echoing.&nbsp;
Note that AWT must be available, this cannot be done via Unix telnet etc.
<p><b>Note on sessions:</b>&nbsp; To retain the session data between HTTP
and HTTPS pages, you must use the port numbers 80 and 443, and use the
URLs without a port number.&nbsp; If you are using a connector for an iPlanet/Netscape
server or an Apache server, then you can use any ports for the Blazix servers,
but the front end servers must use ports 80 and 443.
<p>The reason is as follows:
<p>Browsers consider http://www.yoursite.com/ and https://www.yoursite.com/
to be the same site and will send back the session cookie.
<p>But if you have to include a port number, e.g. http://www.yoursite.com/
and https://www.yoursite.com:444/, then browsers will consider these URLs
coming from two different sites and will not send back the session cookie.
<p>Therefore port numbers cannot be included in the URL when switching
between HTTP and HTTPS servers, and therefore the default port numbers
of 80 and 443 must be used.
<h4>
<a NAME="keystore"></a>Keystore</h4>
A "keystore" is required for enabling SSL.&nbsp; The JDK 1.3 version of
the keytool utility is required for creating keystores.&nbsp; For testing
and initial setup, the sample keystore that comes with JSSE can also be
used.&nbsp; See the keytool documentation <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html">for
Solaris</a> or <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html">for
Windows</a>, for details on using the keytool utility.
<p>The steps required are outlined below:
<ul>
<li>
Generate a keypair using the "keytool -genkey" command.&nbsp; Make sure
to give this command the "-keyalg RSA" argument as this will probably be
required by your certificate authority.&nbsp; E.g.</li>

<br><tt><font size=-1>keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore keyfile.key
-keypass yourPassword</font></tt>
<br>This command will ask you to repeat the password, and will ask several
questions.&nbsp; When it asks for "your first and last name", <b>do not</b>
give it your personal first and last name!&nbsp; Give it the web-site's
URL, e.g. <tt>www.yoursite.com</tt>
<br>This will create the keystore in a file called "keyfile.key" and will
place a public and private key pair in the keystore.
<li>
Generate a certificate request using the "keytool -certreq" command, e.g.</li>

<br><tt><font size=-1>keytool -certreq -keystore keyfile.key -file certreq.txt</font></tt>
<br>This will generate a certificate request and place it in the file "certreq.txt".
<li>
Give the certificate request to your chosen certificate authority.</li>

<li>
When the certificate authority gives you a "reply", obtain it in the "<tt>PKCS
#7 Certificate Chain</tt>" format, and place it in a file.</li>

<li>
Import the reply into your keystore by using the "keytool -import" command
e.g.</li>

<br><tt><font size=-1>keytool -import -keystore keyfile.key -file certreply.txt</font></tt>
<br>You might see a "certificate root not trusted" warning if you are using
a CA other than the ones whose certificates come pre-installed with JSSE.&nbsp;
This is ok as long as you are sure the certificate is coming from the valid
source.&nbsp; (You can also request the CA certificate from your CA and
install it as a trusted root certificate.)
<li>
The keystore is now ready to be given to Blazix using the <tt>ssl.keystore</tt>
parameter.</li>
</ul>
For testing purposes, you can also use the "keytool -selfcert" to generate
self-signed certificates.&nbsp;</td>
