<h2>
Adding username and password to web pages and EJBs</h2>

<h3>
Basic authorization requirements</h3>
In order to add username/password protection to web pages and EJBs, Blazix
needs to be told two pieces of information:
<ul>
<li>
What are the resources that should be placed under protection.</li>

<li>
What are the valid username/password combinations</li>
</ul>
Given these two pieces of information, the web pages are protected using
the standard "Basic" or "Form" based authentication.&nbsp; In these methods,
the end-user provides the username and password using standard user interfaces.&nbsp;
The configuration file only needs to provide the information about whether
to use "Basic" or "Form" based authentication, and parameters for the authentication
method selected.
<p>For Enterprise Java Beans, an additional mechanism is necessary whereby
the client of the EJB can specify the username and password at runtime.&nbsp;
In the case where the EJB is being accessed from a web-page, this is handled
automatically, and the username/password supplied by the end-user is transmitted
to the EJB as well.&nbsp; For other stand-alone EJB clients, a mechanism
is provided to specify the username/password needed to access the EJB.
<h3>
Specifying the authentication method for the Web-Server</h3>
For the web-server, the available authentication methods are "Basic" and
"Form".&nbsp; In the "Basic" method, the user's browser presents the standard
username/password dialog box to the user.&nbsp; In this method, the application
has no control over the looks of this dialog.&nbsp; In the "Form" method,
a particular HTML form is designated as the login form.&nbsp; This form
must have two fields called "j_username" and "j_password".&nbsp; The "ACTION"
of the form must be "j_security_check".&nbsp; In addition to the login
form, an error page must be specified.&nbsp; If the username and password
entered are not valid, the browser is redirected to the error page.
<p>The authentication method is selected by the configurtion property application.&lt;appname>.authType
and should be set to "Basic" or "Form".&nbsp; (For the default application,
use the pre-defined application name "default".)&nbsp; For "Basic" authentication,
an "application.&lt;appname>.authRealm" must be supplied.&nbsp; The user's
browser displays this in the username/password dialog box.&nbsp; For "Form"
authentication, application.&lt;appname>.authLoginForm and application.&lt;appname>.authErrorPage
must be supplied.&nbsp; E.g.
<blockquote>
<pre>application.default.authType: Form
application.default.authLoginForm: /login.html
application.default.authErrorPage: /loginFailed.html</pre>
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
<pre>application.default.authType: Basic
application.default.authRealm: TestSite</pre>
</blockquote>
<b>Blazix extension for logging out a user:</b>&nbsp; In the "Form" authentication
method.&nbsp; The logged in user's name is stored in the session object
as the attribute "<tt>desisoft.form.authorization</tt>".&nbsp; Remove this
attribute to log out the user.&nbsp; Users cannot be logged out in the
"Basic" method, because the browser stores the authentication information.
<h3>
Specifying the resources to protect</h3>
This is done in the web-server configuration files, or web or EJB JAR files.&nbsp;
In both cases, as required by the specifications, the authorization is
based on a "role".&nbsp; Each role may have multiple usernames associated
with it.&nbsp; In the web server, simply specifying a URL in a "role.&lt;role-name>.url"
configuration parameter protects the URL.&nbsp; The URL may be specified
as a full URL, or with wildcards of the form "&lt;path>/*" or "*.&lt;extension>".&nbsp;
For example:
<pre>role.name: user
role.user.url: /safearea/*
role.user.url: *.jsp</pre>
The above configuration says that all URLs that start with /safearea/ and
all URLs ending in ".jsp" are accessible to role name "user".&nbsp;&nbsp;
If no roles have been specified for a URL, it is considered un-protected.
<p>For packaged web archives, the WEB-INF/web.xml file contains the role
names and the URLs being protected by the rols.
<p>In the case of EJBs, the packaged EJB jar file contains a ejb-jar.xml
file which lists the roles that have access to the EJB.&nbsp; There is
no configuration-file equivalent for this, since there is no "default"
EJB.
<h3>
Specifying the valid username/password combinations</h3>
The valid username/password combinations are specified by supplying an
implementation of the <a href="AuthCheck.html">desisoft.deploy.AuthCheck</a>
interface.
<p>Blazix includes a default file-based implementation of this interface.&nbsp;
Therefore in the simplest scenario, the valid username/password combinations
need to be added in a file and this file specified in the Web server or
EJB server configuration file.
<p>For the web-server, this is done on a per-application basis.&nbsp; For
the basic case with only a single application, the application name "default"
is used.&nbsp; For the EJB server, this is done on a server-wide basis.
<p>If an implementation of <a href="AuthCheck.html">desisoft.deploy.AuthCheck</a>
is being provided, the class implementing the interface is specified in
"application.&lt;appname>.authClass" for web-server and "authClass" for
EJB server.&nbsp; Any parameters for this class are provided by "application.&lt;appname>.authParam.*"
or "authParam.*".
<p>To use the default file-based implementation, do not provide the authClass,
and provide a single parameter
<br>"application.&lt;appname>.authParam.file" or "authParam.file".&nbsp;
(The format of this file is described in the next section.)
<p>Examles:
<br>Web-server configuration file:
<blockquote>
<pre>application.default.authParam.file: htaccess.ini</pre>
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
<pre>application.default.authClass: MyAuth.MyAuthClass
application.default.authParam.myParam: myParamValue</pre>
</blockquote>
EJB-server configuration file:
<blockquote>
<pre>authParam.file: htaccess.ini</pre>
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
<pre>authClass: MyAuth.MyAuthClass
authParam.myParam: myParamValue</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Format of the default authorization file</h3>
The authorization file contains one authorization entry per line.&nbsp;
Each entry consists of comma-separated fields.&nbsp; Any lines starting
with "#" or ";" are considered comments.
<p>The first field in the line is the name of the URL or the EJB.&nbsp;
It can be "*" to indicate that the authorization is&nbsp; for all URLs
or EJBs.&nbsp; The second field in the line is the username.&nbsp; The
third field is the password.&nbsp; Following this, one or more additional
fields are specified for role names.&nbsp; An example of an authorization
file is:
<blockquote>
<pre>*,user1,pwd1,admin,employee
*,user2,pwd2,employee</pre>
</blockquote>
This file is specifying that the username and password "user1/pwd1" are
valid for all URLs/EJBs, and allow access to "admin" and "employee" roles.&nbsp;
The username and password "user2/pwd2" are valid for all URLs/EJBs and
allow access to "employee" role only.
<p>This password file protects all URLs listed in the web server configuration
file, and all EJBs.&nbsp; To selectively protect EJBs, EJB names must be
specified in the first field, and separate authorization files should be
used for the web server and the EJB server.
<h3>
How EJB Cients can specify username/password</h3>
Standalone EJB clients (clients other that JSP pages or servlets) can specify
a username/password for an EJB server by either of of these two mechanisms:
<p>When looking up an EJB home, specify the username and password by adding
them to the environment for initiali JNDI context.&nbsp; The property names
are "desisoft.ejb.username" and "desisoft.ejb.password".&nbsp; E.g.
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties env = new Properties();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; env.put( "java.naming.factory.initial",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "desisoft.ejb.client.JRMPFactory" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; env.put("desisoft.ejb.nameServer1",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "myEjbServer:2010" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; env.put("desisoft.ejb.username", "user1" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; env.put("desisoft.ejb.password", "pwd1" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javax.naming.Context ctx = new InitialContext(env);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyHomeInterface home =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (MyHomeInterface) ctx.lookup( "MyEjbName" );</pre>
Alternatively, the function
<pre>desisoft.ejb.client.Misc.setAuthorization(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String username,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String pwd );</pre>
can be called to specify username and password prior to obtaining an EJB
home or object.
<p>When obtaining an EJB home or object from a handle, only the second
method is available because no JNDI lookup is involved.
<p><b>Blazix extension for finding out the authorized user's name:</b>&nbsp;
From an entity or a session bean, the current authorized username can be
retrieved by calling the (base class) method
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>public String _ds_getUsername();</tt>
<p>It will return the username if a user has been authorized, or null.
