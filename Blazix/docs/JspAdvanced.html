<h3>
<a NAME="forms"></a>Forms Processing</h3>
If you have processed user input from HTML forms in JSP, you will appreciate
the changes Blazix brings!
<p>Blazix takes advantage of JSP 1.1 "standard tag library" mechanism to
add a Blazix tag library.&nbsp; There are only two tags added by Blazix
tag library for forms processing, but just these two tags can cut down
your forms processing workload by more than half!&nbsp; See the <a href="Taglib.html">Blazix
tag library</a> for details on how to use the Blazix tag library and details
on the forms processing tags.
<h3>
<a NAME="sql"></a>SQL</h3>
SQL is often used in conjunction with JSPs.&nbsp; In addition to the forms
processing tags, Blazix also includes a short and effective set of SQL
tags to make SQL writing an easy task.
<h3>
<a NAME="email"></a>Email</h3>
Sending email from a JSP page is very simple with Blazix.&nbsp; Simple
email, HTML email or email with attachments can all be handled very easily.&nbsp;
See <a href="Taglib.html">Blazix tag library</a> for details .
<h3>
<a NAME="i18n"></a>Internationalization</h3>
Just because JSP makes it so easy to embed Java code directly inside HTML,
internationalization can become much more complicated!&nbsp; Blazix tag
library also includes tags for internationalization.&nbsp; These do require
a bit more work for tagging the pieces of language to translate, but this
little bit of extra work saves serious troubles at internationalization
time.
<h3>
<a NAME="reserved"></a>Reserved Variable Names</h3>
Blazix reserves variables name starting with <tt>_ds</tt> or <tt>_desisoft</tt>
or <tt>_blazix</tt> and attribute name strings starting with "<tt>desisoft.</tt>"
or "<tt>blazix.</tt>".&nbsp; These prefixes should not be used in development.
<h3>
<a NAME="wsp"></a>WSP</h3>
Blazix also makes the JSP technology available for writing WML, for wireless
devices.&nbsp; You can just write normal WML pages, rename them with the
extension .wsp, and embed Java in them as with the .jsp pages.&nbsp; The
server will take care of the book-keeping.&nbsp; It will track the different
versions of index.jsp, index.wsp etc. The wireless visitors will be automatically
routed to index.wml and index.wsp instead of index.html and index.jsp.&nbsp;
And if any situations require a message from the server, the message will
go in approprite WML instead of in HTML.</td>
