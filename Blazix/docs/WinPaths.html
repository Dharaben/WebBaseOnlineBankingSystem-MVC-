<h3>
Setting PATH and CLASSPATH on Windows</h3>
In Java server programming using Blazix, there are many occasions when
programmers will need to be familiar with setting these variables.&nbsp;
Instructions are provided here on changing <tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>
variables for those who have not had occasion to use these variables.
<p><tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> are "<tt>environment variables</tt>".&nbsp;
Both of these are a list of "<tt>directories</tt>" (also known as "<tt>folders</tt>".)&nbsp;
In addition, <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> can also contain files with the ".jar"
exension.
<p>The elements of the list are separated by the semicolon character.&nbsp;
An example of a <tt>PATH</tt> variable is
<p><tt>C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System;c:\Jdk1.3\bin;C:\Windows\COMMAND</tt>
<p>In this example, the <tt>PATH</tt> variable contains four entries, <tt>C:\Windows</tt>,
<tt>C:\Windows\System</tt>, <tt>C:\Jdk1.3.bin</tt> and <tt>C:\Windows\COMMAND</tt>,
all of them separated by the semicolon character.
<p>The <tt>PATH</tt> variables tells the Windows system where to find programs.&nbsp;
For instance, if you type
<p><tt>java</tt>
<p>in a Command prompt window, the system looks in all directories listed
in <tt>PATH</tt> for a file named "<tt>java.exe</tt>".&nbsp; For the example
above, the system will look in <tt>C:\Windows</tt>, then in <tt>C:\Windows\System</tt>,
and then in <tt>C:\Jdk1.3\bin</tt> where it will presumably find the file
<tt>java.exe</tt>
and will then execute it.&nbsp; Since it has already found <tt>java.exe</tt>,
it will not need to look further in the <tt>PATH</tt>.
<p>The <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> variable is similar to <tt>PATH</tt>, but it
is used by Java instead of the Windows system.&nbsp; It tells the <tt>java</tt>,
<tt>javac</tt>
and other Java commands, where to find classes.&nbsp; It can contain both
directories as well as JAR files, because both can contain classes.&nbsp;
If a class is part of a package, the package name is added to the directories
in the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.&nbsp; So if the
<tt>CLASSPATH</tt> contains
a directory <tt>C:\MyClasses</tt> and the class is "<tt>mypackage.MyClass</tt>",
java will try to find a file called <tt>C:\MyClasses\mypackage\MyClass.class</tt>.&nbsp;
If the class is not part of a package, java will look for it directly in
<tt>C:\MyClasses</tt>.
<p>To see your <tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> variables, type "<tt>SET</tt>"
in a Command prompt window.
<p>You may not have the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> variable, in which case you
will need to add one.
<p>Follow the steps below to set the <tt>PATH</tt> and <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>
variables
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#win98me">On Windows 98 or ME</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#nt2k">On Windows/NT or Windows/2000</a></li>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="win98me"></a><b>Windows 98/ME:</b>&nbsp; There is a file
called<tt> C:\autoexec.bat</tt> on your system.&nbsp; Edit this file in
a text editor such as notepad.&nbsp; This file should already contain an
entry for <tt>PATH</tt>.&nbsp; It may also contain an entry for <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.&nbsp;
If it does have an entry for <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>, simply add
<p><tt>C:\Blazix\blazix.jar</tt>
<p>to the existing <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> entry (make sure to separate it from
the other entries by a semicolon!)&nbsp; If your <tt>autoexec.bat</tt>
file does not contain an entry for <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>, add a new line
<p><tt>SET CLASSPATH=.;C:\Blazix\blazix.jar</tt>
<p>to your autoexec.bat.&nbsp; Java will interpret the "." (the dot character)
here as "the current directory".
<p>Similarly, add <tt>C:\Blazix</tt> to your <tt>PATH</tt> entry.&nbsp; If
your javac.exe is not in your <tt>PATH</tt> (i.e. if typing "<tt>javac</tt>"
in a command window gives you a "<tt>bad command or file name</tt>"), you
will also need to find where your <tt>javac.exe</tt> (which is a part of
your JDK) is, and add that directory to <tt>PATH</tt>.
<p><b>IMPORTANT WARNING:</b>&nbsp; YOU MUST NOT ADD SOMETHING LIKE THE
FOLLOWING IN YOUR <tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> FILE.
<p><tt>SET PATH=C:\Blazix</tt>
<p>This is because you absolutely <b>must</b> retain the old setting of
the <tt>PATH</tt>.&nbsp; If you don't see an entry for <tt>PATH</tt> in
the autoexec.bat file, type "<tt>PATH</tt>" in a command window to view
the old setting of <tt>PATH</tt>.&nbsp; Add C:\Blazix to the existing entries,
and then add a line to your <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> file.&nbsp; E.g., if
by typing "<tt>PATH</tt>" you see "<tt>PATH=C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System;C:\Windows\COMMAND</tt>",
then your addition to the autoexec.bat file will be
<p><tt>SET PATH=C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System;C:\Windows\COMMAND;C:\Blazix</tt>
<p>After you are done changing your <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> file, save it
and <b>reboot</b> your computer so the changes will take effect.
<p><a NAME="nt2k"></a><b>Windows/NT or Windows/2000:</b>&nbsp; Open the
"<tt>System</tt>" icon from your Control Panel.&nbsp; On 2000, go to the
"<tt>Advanced</tt>" tab and click the "<tt>Environment</tt>" button.&nbsp;
On NT, go to the "<tt>Environment</tt>" tab.&nbsp; You should now see entries
for <tt>PATH</tt> and also possibly for <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.
<p>Add <tt>C:\Blazix</tt> to your <tt>PATH</tt> and add <tt>C:\Blazix\blazix.jar</tt>
to your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.&nbsp; Make sure to separate the new entries
from the previous entries by the semicolon character.&nbsp; If the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>
does not exist, add a new environment variable <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> and set
it to <tt>.;C:\Blazix\blazix.jar</tt>
<p>Type "<tt>javac</tt>" in a command window.&nbsp; If it does not invoke
the Java compiler, do a search to find out where your "<tt>javac.exe</tt>"
file (from your JDK) is, and add that directory to your <tt>PATH</tt> also.
