Redistribution
==============

The files in this location are meant for redistribution.
The blx.tld file should be placed in the root directory,
and added to web archives before distributing web archives.

(Note that this is NOT the location for .tld files.  Place
.tld files in the "webfiles" or other location as defined
by your initialization file and the URL of the .tld file.)
