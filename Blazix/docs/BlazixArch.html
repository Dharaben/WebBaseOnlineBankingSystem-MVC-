<h1>
Overview</h1>
The Blazix Java Server consists of a Web Server, an EJB Server, and various
tools, including an EJB generator wizard called "Blizzard", JSP debugging
code generator, Web application packager, Remote administrator, and clustering
support software.
<p>Several Blazix Web Server can be put together in co-operative clusters
managed by front-end load-balancing equipment.&nbsp; EJB Servers can similarly
share the processing load via EJB Naming Servers.
<p>The separation of the Web Servers and the EJB servers allows much flexibility
in designing application architectures.&nbsp; For instance, Web Servers
can be accessible via the firewall, without needing to expose the EJB Servers
which can be completely inside the firewall and still provide the processing
needed by the Web Servers.&nbsp; The number of Web Servers or the number
of EJB servers can be grown independently of the other, based upon the
load characteristics.
<p>The diagram below shows a possible deployment scenario.&nbsp; The web
servers form one cluster, and are backed up by cluster session backup servers.&nbsp;
The EJB servers form another cluster.&nbsp; Thus as the load increases,
the clusters can be easily grown (scalability and performance.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
And at any one time the failure of any one server is not critical because
the other servers in the clusters can pick up the load (reliability.)
