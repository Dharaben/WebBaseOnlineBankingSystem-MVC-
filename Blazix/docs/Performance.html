<h3>
Performance Pointers</h3>
Following are some suggestions to get the best performance from Blazix:
<ul>
<li>
If using server-based clustering, make sure all cluster servers are operational.&nbsp;
Blazix web-servers will lose performance if they are continually trying
to connect to a cluster server.</li>

<li>
Set-up EJBs to use the IIOP protocol instead of the JRMP default.</li>

<li>
Set-up EJB data cacheing in the most appropriate manner for your application.&nbsp;
This is a tradeoff between performance and reliability, and many applications
may be able to get better performance by changing the default cacheing
behavior (default is "on" for loads, "save if changed" for stores.&nbsp;
If cacheing being "on" is acceptable for stores, this may have significant
performance improvement.)</li>

<li>
Minimize Java synchronizations.&nbsp; If there are multiple synchronizations
in a class, use separate lock objects rather than "<tt>this</tt>" if the
synchronizations are unrelated.</li>

<li>
When the web-site files are no longer changing, pack them in a WAR file
using the Archive Packer tool, instead of keeping them as separate files.&nbsp;
Note that the "<tt>default</tt>" application can also be set-up to run
from a WAR file.</li>

<li>
Make sure entity EJBs are backed by a fast database.&nbsp; Database performance
is a limiting factor in Entity Bean performance.</li>

<li>
Do not unnecessarily flush or close "<tt>out</tt>" in JSP files.&nbsp;
If output has not been flushed and the total data length is available at
connection commit time, Blazix will be able to honor the Netscape browsers'
"<tt>Connection: keep-alive</tt>" request, thereby improving performance.</li>
</ul>
