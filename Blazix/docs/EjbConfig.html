<h2>
EJB-Server Configuration</h2>

<h3>
Location</h3>
The configuration file may be specified using the -c switch in the command
line, e.g.
<blockquote>
<pre>blxejbs -c c:\Mylocation\myejb.ini
or
java desisoft.ejb.server.EjbServer -c c:\Mylocation\myejb.ini</pre>
</blockquote>
If the file is not specified on the command line, the EJB-server searches
for a configuration file in the following order:
<ul>
<li>
if the Java property "desisoft.ejb.server.config" is set, it uses its value
for the configuration file name.</li>

<li>
it looks in the hardwired locations c:\BlazixEjbServer.ini (for Windows)
and /usr/blazix/EjbServer.ini (for Unix).</li>

<li>
it looks for an ejb.ini file in the current directory.</li>
</ul>
(The installation process starts off with the last option above.)
<h3>
Concepts</h3>
<b>Name Servers:</b>&nbsp; Any EJB server can act as a "name server".&nbsp;
A name server may or may not deploy beans of its own.&nbsp; It serves as
the connection point beteen EJB clients and EJB servers, and allows the
EJB services to be provided by distributed servers.
<p>Other EJB servers need to register with one or more name servers.&nbsp;
In the simplest scenario, there is only one EJB server which acts as a
name server for all its own EJB home objects.
<p><b>Data Sources:</b> One or more JDBC "data sources" can be configured
in the server.&nbsp; All entity beans must have a data source connected
to them.&nbsp; Additional data sources may be provided to entity beans
or session beans.&nbsp; To take advantage of Blazix transaction management,
session beans must only use data sources that are configured in the server&nbsp;&nbsp;
The data sources can also be directly accessed at the JNDI location java:comp/env/jdbc/&lt;data-source-name>
and will return an object of type javax.sql.DataSource which can be used
to obtain pooled connections.
<p>Data sources are configured by specifying a driverClass and a database
url, or by providing an implementation of <a href="JdbcResourceFactory.html">desisoft.deploy.JdbcResourceFactory,</a>
or by providing an ODBC name.
<p>See <a href="DataSources.html">JDBC data sources</a> for more information.
<p><b>Cache</b>:&nbsp; The entity bean data can be cached in a combination
of ways.&nbsp; There are two options, "<tt>loadCache</tt>" and "<tt>storeCache</tt>".&nbsp;
If "<tt>loadCache</tt>" is on, the entity bean data will be cached for
database loads, i.e. the data will not be refreshed from persistence storage
at the beginning of each method invocation.&nbsp; If "<tt>loadCache</tt>"
is off, the data will be refreshed at the beginning of each method invocation.&nbsp;
If "<tt>storeCache</tt>" is off, the data will be saved to persistent storage
at the end of each method invocation.&nbsp; If "<tt>storeCache</tt>" is
on, the data will be saved to persistent storage only when the entity bean
is passivated (this happens after a timeout period) or when the the server
is gracefully shut down.&nbsp; The "<tt>storeCache</tt>" may also be set
to "<tt>nochange</tt>".&nbsp; This indicates that the server will try to
determine if a method call has changed the data.&nbsp; If data has not
been changed, it will not be written back to the persistent storage.&nbsp;
If the EJB has complex fields, server will not try to determine if data
has changed because in this case the overhead may exceed the performance
benefits.&nbsp; Therefore in EJBs with complex fields, "<tt>nochange</tt>"
is identical to "<tt>off</tt>".&nbsp; In bean-managed persistence also
"<tt>nochange</tt>" is identical to "<tt>off</tt>" because the server is
not managing any fields that it can check for changes.
<p>The defaults are "<tt>on</tt>" for "<tt>loadCache</tt>" and "<tt>nochange</tt>"
for "<tt>storeCache</tt>".
<p>The tradeoffs are as follows.
<p>If "<tt>loadCache</tt>" is on, the performance is better but any third
party changes to the database may not become visible to the entity bean.&nbsp;
If "<tt>loadCache</tt>" is off the performance is slower but the entity
bean will always have the most current data in the database.
<p>If "<tt>storeCache</tt>" is on, the performance will be better but entity
bean changes will not be reflected in the database immediately.&nbsp; A
more serious concern is that if the EJB server crashes, or is brought down
ungracefully (e.g. by typing a Contrl/C in the console), the entity bean
changes may not get written back at all.
<p>For clustering, "<tt>loadCache</tt>" <b>must</b> be set to "<tt>off</tt>"&nbsp;
if the EJB home is being distributed among more than one EJB servers.&nbsp;
The "<tt>storeCache</tt>" may be left at the default value of "<tt>nochange</tt>".
<h3>
Configuration Parameters</h3>
The following configuration file parameters are available:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>server.port</td>

<td>Server port number, e.g. "2050".&nbsp; It must be an integer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>server.address</td>

<td>Server address (primarily for use on machines with multiple IP address.)&nbsp;
This must be a valid hostname or an IP addresses.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>admin.port</td>

<td>Port for administration access.&nbsp; If admin.port or admin.password
are not specified, server will not be remotely administerable.&nbsp; If
running inside a firewall, the admin port should be selected so that it
is NOT accessible through the firewall.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>admin.password</td>

<td>Password for administration access.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejbDir</td>

<td>Path to the directory containing EJB Jar files.&nbsp; These EJB Jar
files will be automatically loaded.
<p>&nbsp;The Jar file must contain a META-INF/ejb-jar.xml describing it.&nbsp;
It must also contain the&nbsp; necessary classes.&nbsp; The Blazix EJB
compiler and the Blizzard EJB Wizard can be used in creating EJB Jar files.
<p>Loading an ejbJar automatically registers the names of the Enterprise
Beans in it, so other parameters of the form ejb.&lt;name>.param can use
these names.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejbJar</td>

<td>Path to an EJB Jar file.
<br>This is an alternate method of loading EJBs, other than "ejbDir".&nbsp;
Live deployment and re-deployment are not available for EJB Jar files that
are loaded using this method instead of by placing them in the directory
specified by "ejbDir".</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.protocol</td>

<td>The protocol to use for EJB communications.&nbsp; This can either be
<tt>JRMP</tt>
or <tt>IIOP</tt>.&nbsp; All existing EJBs must be recompiled after this
setting has been changed.&nbsp; The server must be restarted, and the clients
must be changed to use the appropriate factory.
<br>This must match the ejb.protocol setting in web-server configuration
files.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.loadCache</td>

<td>Cacheing behavior for loading data from persistent storage.&nbsp; May
be "off" or "on".&nbsp; This parameter provides the EJB server's default
behavior, and may be overridden for individual EJBs.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.storeCache</td>

<td>Cacheing behavior for savubg data to persistent storage.&nbsp; May
be "off", "on" or "nochange".&nbsp; This parameter provides the EJB server's
default behavior, and may be overridden for individual EJBs.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>iiop.iorFile</td>

<td>This is only available if the ejb.protocol is IIOP.&nbsp; This should
point to the path of a file.&nbsp; The IOR string will be written to this
file.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>defaultDataSource</td>

<td>A default data source to use for entity beans, if ejb.&lt;name>.dataSource
is not specified.&nbsp; This should be set to the name of a configured
datasource.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>unuse.timeout</td>

<td>Timeout in seconds before unused EJB bean objects will be discarded.&nbsp;
(Entity beans getting discarded has only a performance impact, Session
beans are lost when discarded.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ususe.interval</td>

<td>How often the check for "unuse.timeout" should be done.&nbsp; This
should not be made too small, otherwise performance will degrade.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>isNameServer</td>

<td>Set to true to indicate whether the EJB server should also operate
as a name server.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.nameServer</td>

<td>An EJB name server with which the EJB server should register all its
HOME objects.&nbsp; The parameter can be repeated multiple times, to register
with multiple name servers.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>license.file</td>

<td>Path of license file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>startup.asynchronous</td>

<td>Name of a class that implements "Runnable".&nbsp; This class will be
instantiated and started in a separate thread during server startup.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>startup.synchronous</td>

<td>Name of a class that implemens "Runnable".&nbsp; This class will be
intantiated and its "run" method will be called during server startup.&nbsp;
Server startup wil not proceed until the "run" method returns.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.name</td>

<td>This is not used, because the EJB names are defined by loading EJB
Jar files using ejbJar.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.&lt;name>.jndiName</td>

<td>The JNDI name at which the EJB will be available.&nbsp; If not specified,
the JNDI name is the same as the EJB name.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.&lt;name>.dataSource</td>

<td>DataSource name for Entity beans.&nbsp; All entity beans must have
a data source.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.&lt;name>.table</td>

<td>Name of the database table for storing entity bean data.&nbsp; All
entity beans must have a database table.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.&lt;name>.field.*</td>

<td>The field names in the database table can be the same as the entity
bean field names.&nbsp; But if the field names are different, the mapping
must be provided using this parameter.&nbsp; E.g.
<br>ejb.myEjb.field.beanField: tableField</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ejb.&lt;name>.upcaseColumnNames</td>

<td>This can have a true or false value.&nbsp; If set to false, column
names will not be upper-cased before being given to the database.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The default is true.&nbsp; This field is ignored if a column map has been
specified in the ejb-jar.xml.</td>
</tr>

<td>If provided, it must be the name of a class that implements <a href="AuthCheck.html">desisoft.deploy.AuthCheck</a>&nbsp;
The class will be instantiated, and all username/password values for the
EJBs will be given to the instantiated object&nbsp; for authentication.&nbsp;
Blazix provides a default file-based implementation of this class, see
<a href="Authorization.html">Authorization.</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>authParam.*</td>

<td>Initialization parameters to be passed to the object instantiated for
application.&lt;name>.authClass.&nbsp; The default file-based authorization
requires one initialization parameter, application.&lt;name>.authParam.file,
which should be set to the path of the file containing usernames and passwords.</td>
