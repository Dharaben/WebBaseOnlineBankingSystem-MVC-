<h2>
JSP for Beginners</h2>
For beginners learning JSP, we recommend the JSP tutorial at <a href="http://www.jsptut.com/jsptut.html">http://www.jsptut.com/</a>
<p>There are some server specific items that you need to know:
<p>As you go through the JSP tutorial, the JSP files will be placed in
<tt>C:\Blazix\webfiles</tt>
folder (unless you have modified the default configuration.)&nbsp; The
URL for the top level of this folder is http://DESKTOP-NKM5MK3/&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. the
file <tt>C:\Blazix\webfiles\test\hello.jsp</tt>, would correspond to the
URL <a href="http://DESKTOP-NKM5MK3/hello.jsp">http://DESKTOP-NKM5MK3/test/hello.jsp</a> in your
browser.
<p>The JSP directory is for holding temporary JSP files, not for classes
used by the JSP files.&nbsp; If your JSP is using any classes (e.g. a bean,)
you can place the class files in the <tt>C:\Blazix\classes</tt> folder.&nbsp;
You can also place it in any folder in your CLASSPATH.&nbsp; If you have
to change the CLASSPATH, make sure to stop and restart the web server so
it can pick up the new CLASSPATH.&nbsp; (Depending upon your system, you
may also have to reboot the machine or log out and log back in so your
new CLASSPATH is in effect.)&nbsp; Jar files cannot be added to the <tt>C:\Blazix\classes</tt>
folder, they must be added to the CLASSPATH.
<p>After learning JSP, if you find you need to debug a JSP in Blazix, there
is a "<a href="Tools.html#jspDebug">jspdebug</a>" command available, that
you can use to generate debuggable Java files.
<p>Blazix also has the ability to <a href="I18n.html">internationalize</a>
your JSPs easily, so you can write JSPs that will be seen differently by
visitors with different language preferences.
<p>Blazix enables the ".wsp" extension for WML files, so you can take advantage
of JSP technology for creating dynamic pages for wireless devices.
