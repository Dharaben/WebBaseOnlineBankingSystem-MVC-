<h2>
Dynamic Stream Access Protocol (DSAP) for dynamic programming over the
web</h2>

<h3>
Overview</h3>
The HTTP protocol is designed primarily for static page access.&nbsp; In
the modern environment, it is often desirable to access the web more dynamically
than the request-response metaphor.&nbsp; Doing dynamic programming within
the limitations of the request-response metaphor has given rise to some
extremely complicated software designs.
<p>The Dynamic Stream Access Protocol (DSAP) offered in Blazix makes it
very simple to access resources dynamically over the web as a two-way stream
rather than a request/response exchange.&nbsp; This allows applets, plugins
or standalone programs to access a website and conduct a full remote access
session without being restricted to translating all requirements into some
form of request/response.
<h3>
Using DSAP in Blazix</h3>

<h4>
Server side</h4>
To provide the server side of DSAP in Blazix, write an implementation of
<tt>desisoft.dsap.Server</tt>
interface.&nbsp; This interface has two entry points.
<p><tt>public interface desisoft.dsap.Server {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean authCheck( String username, String
pwd );</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; public void onConnect( String arg,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ServletInputStream input,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ServletOutputStream output )</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IOException;</tt>
<br><tt>}</tt>
<p>The a<tt>uthCheck()</tt> method will be called with a username and password
if they have been supplied, otherwise it will be called with (<tt>null</tt>,
<tt>null</tt>)
as arguments.&nbsp; It should return a false if access should be denied.
<p>The <tt>onConnect()</tt> method is called to process the remote request.&nbsp;
The input and output streams provide data to and from the client.
<p>The <tt>onConnect()</tt> method is called in an independent thread.&nbsp;
This method must not return until the session is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(If separate threads are started for any processing, the initial thread
should ensure termination of these before returning.)&nbsp; When the method
returns, the socket will be closed.
<p>To register your implementation class, add an entry in the Webserver
configuration file of the form:
<p><tt><font size=-1>dsap.name: &lt;a-name-for-this-dsap-instance></font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>dsap.&lt;name>.className:&nbsp; &lt;fully-qualified-name-of-class-implementing-dsap></font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>dsap.&lt;name>.url:&nbsp; &lt;a-connection-string-that-the-client-will-need-to-know></font></tt>
<p>The URL is not a HTTP URL, it is simply a connection string that the
client and server agree on.&nbsp; It does not relate to a physical filename.&nbsp;
An example entry is
<p><tt>dsap.name:&nbsp; MyDsapServer</tt>
<br><tt>dsap.MyDsapServer.className: my.dsap.server</tt>
<br><tt>dsap.MyDsapServer.url: /my/dsapserver</tt>
<p>The DSAP class must be public and must have a public no-argument constructor.&nbsp;
The <tt>doConnect</tt>&nbsp; method must be written to support multithreading
because it may be called in multiple threads simultaneously -- if there
are any shared resources, access to them must be synchronized.
<p>The connection string may contain a "?" followed by an argument string
in the standard HTTP syntax.&nbsp; If such an argument is provided, it
will be passed to doConnect as "<tt>arg</tt>", otherwise "<tt>arg</tt>"
will be <tt>null</tt>.
<p>Connection strings starting with "<tt>blazix:</tt>" are reserved for
Blazix internal usage.
<p>If the DSAP class buffers the output, the output must be flushed before
it will be seen by the client!
<h4>
The DSAP client</h4>
The DSAP client can be written in any language.&nbsp; For convenience,
a Blazix class <a href="DsapClient.html">desisoft.dsap.Client</a> has been
provided that can be used for this purpose.&nbsp; Sample usage is shown
below:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt> desisoft.dsap.Client client =</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new desisoft.dsap.Client();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; client.connect( "www.myhost.com", "/my/dsapserver"
);</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Argumets may be specified using
the</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // syntax "/my/dsapserver?argument"</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; java.io.InputStream input =&nbsp; client.getInputStream();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; java.io.OutputStream output = client.getOutputStream();</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; // Now input,output can be used for communication</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; // with the server.&nbsp; Reminder: if the output
is buffered, it</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; // must be flushed before the server will see it!</tt>
<h4>
Writing DSAP clients in other languages</h4>
DSAP clients can be written in any language that supports socket connections.&nbsp;
The client simply needs to make a socket connection, and send the line
<p><tt>CONNECT &lt;connection-string> DSAP/1.0</tt>
<p>where "<tt>&lt;connection-string></tt>" stands for the actual connection
string.&nbsp; The connection string is not case-sensitive.&nbsp; It should
be URL-encoded, particularly if it contains any space characters.
<p>Following the first line, the client may send any other configuration
lines.&nbsp; Finally the client must send an empty line (similar to HTTP.)
<p>Lines are terminated by a &lt;CR>&lt;LF> sequence.
<p>Currently, the only configuration line defined is for authentication.&nbsp;
If authentication is required, it must be supplied in the same form as
the HTTP "Basic" authentication.
<p>After the empty line has been sent, the client will get a response which
will consist of four bytes.&nbsp; For success, the response consists of
the characters '_' '1' &lt;CR> and &lt;LF> and for failure, the response
consists of the characters '_' '0' &lt;CR> and &lt;LF> (the byte values
are 95, 49, 13, 10 for success and 95, 48, 13, 10 for failure.)
<p>If the response is a success, the session is started.&nbsp; The input/output
of the client are now connected to the output/input streams of the DSAP
server class.&nbsp; If the response is a failure, any following data will
consist of an error number followed by a space and an error message text.&nbsp;
Numbers in the 1001-1100 range should be used for the particular server-specific
error.
<p>A sample session is:
<p><i>Client:</i>&nbsp; <tt>CONNECT /my/dsapserver DSAP/1.0&lt;CR>&lt;LF>&lt;CR>&lt;LF></tt>
<br><i>Server:</i> _<tt>1&lt;CR>&lt;LF></tt>
<p>Client and server can now send any arbitrary data to each other until
one of them decides to close the connection.
<p>A failed sample session is:
<br><i>Client:</i>&nbsp; <tt>CONNECT /my/dsapserver DSAP/1.0&lt;CR>&lt;LF>&lt;CR>&lt;LF></tt>
<br><i>Server:</i> _0<tt>&lt;CR>&lt;LF>1122 Database is down&lt;CR>&lt;LF></tt>
<h4>
Firewalls</h4>
Tunnelling DSAP over HTML can have problems with proxy servers etc, because
there is a large number and variety of proxy servers, and many of them
understand and expect varying levels of the HTTP protocol.
<p>Instead, Desiderata Software recommends configuing two ports in the
firewall for DSAP.&nbsp; Recommended standard port numbers are port 180
for normal connections and port 543 for SSL connections using DSAP.&nbsp;
A separate instance of the Blazix web-server can then be run over these
ports.
<h4>
Other Restrictions</h4>
The DSAP protocol is only available in Blazix if Blazix is being used directly
as a web-server, and not if it is being used as a Java-processing back-end
for another front-end sever.&nbsp; (This is because the front-end servers
are limited to the request-response protocol, and are not designed to provide
data as it arrives.)
<p>In practice, this should not be a significant restriction because Blazix
happens to be efficient enough that it can serve very high volume sites
without needing a front-end C++ server.
