<h2>
The Blazix tag library:&nbsp; Internationalization tags</h2>

<h3>
Translation Overview</h3>
The Blazix internationalization tags make it possible to mark the natural-language
parts of the JSPs, provide multiple translations for the natural-language
parts, and have the appropriate translation be delivered at run-time.
<p>There are two tags: &lt;blx:xltFile> and &lt;blx:xlt>.
<p>The entire text which is to be translated should be placed inside &lt;blx:xltFile>
and &lt;/blx:xltFile>.&nbsp; This tag provides a "base name" for the translation
file.&nbsp; There is no need to have separate base names for separate JSP
pages, the entire site could have a single set of translation files.&nbsp;
Or more, as convenient.
<p>A "language suffix" is added to "base name" to obtain the actual translation
file name.&nbsp; For instance, if the translation file is "translationFile",
and if the current user's language is german, then the filename which will
be used will be "translationFile_de", because the language code for german
is "de".&nbsp; The language codes can be further narrowed by specifying
a country code and a variant, as per Java Locale conventions.&nbsp; The
narrowest filename which is available, will be used.&nbsp; Therefore if
the user's language code is "en_uk" and a "translationFile_en_uk" is available,
that file will be used.&nbsp; Otherwise, if a "translationFile_en" is available,
that will be used.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; The translation tool has language
codes for a wide number of languages, built it.)
<p>If no translation file is available, the original text will be used.
<p>In addtion the language suffix to the base name, extensions are preserved.&nbsp;
If any file extension (starting with the dot charcter) is present, the
language suffix will be added before the dot.&nbsp; So if the base file
is "translate.txt" and the language code is "fr", the resulting filename
will be "translate_fr.txt".
<p>The &lt;blx:xlt> tag is used to tag the English (or other natural language)
text which is to be translated.
<p>An example is:
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;blx:xltFile file="translate.txt">
&lt;P>&lt;blx:xlt ref="intro">
Introduction to
this site..
&lt;/blx:xlt>&lt;br>
&lt;blx:xlt ref="getname">Enter your name here&lt;/blx:xlt>
&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=savename.jsp>
&lt;INPUT NAME=name TYPE=TEXT>
&lt;INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=&lt;blx:xlt ref="submit">Submit&lt;/blx:xlt>>
&lt;/FORM>
&lt;/blx:xltFile></pre>
</blockquote>
The translation file format is
<blockquote>
<pre>tag=value</pre>
</blockquote>
with one translation per line.&nbsp; Lines starting with the dash ("-")
character are considered continuation of the previous line (the dash will
be replaced by line separator characters.)
<p>For instance, the translation file for french for the above example
would be named translate_fr.txt and it might contain the following text
<blockquote>
<pre>intro=Introduction &agrave;
-ce site
getname=&eacute;crivez votre nom ici
submit=Soumettent</pre>
</blockquote>
Use the Blazix Tag Extractor tool to collect all translation tags from
your JSP files and give them to translators for individual languge translation.
<p>Individual XLT tags are described below.
<h3>
blx:xltFile</h3>
This tag can be used to build internationalizable JSPs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>The name provided by the "file" attribute is&nbsp; the "base" name
of the translation file.&nbsp; A locale specific extension is then added
to pull in&nbsp;&nbsp; the appropriate language translation file.&nbsp;
For instance if the base name is "myfile" and the language is "fr", the
translation file will be "myfile_fr".&nbsp; If the file has an extension,
the language id is added before the extension.&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; for "myfile.txt"
and language id "fr", the tag library will look to see if "myfile_fr.txt"
exists.

<h3>
blx:xlt</h3>
The text which should be translated is placed inside this tag.&nbsp; The
tag itself has a a reference id "ref".&nbsp; This reference id is then
used by translators to provide other language translations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>At runtime, the translation for the visitor's language is pulled from
the translation files using the "id" attribute.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>All occurences of this tag must be inside an "xlatFile" tag.
