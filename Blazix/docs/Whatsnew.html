<h2>
What is new in Blazix 1.1 and 1.2</h2>
This page is for Blazix users who are familiar with Blazix 1.0 or 1.1,
and simply want a quick overview of what is new in Blazix.
<p><u><font size=+1>1.2</font></u>
<br><b>Servlets 2.3:</b>&nbsp; Blazix 1.2 catches up to the latest release
of servlets.&nbsp; This version of servlets introduces various things,
most useful of which may be filters.&nbsp; Full details on servlets 2.3
are available at various sites on the web.
<p><b>JSP 1.2:</b>&nbsp; Also added in Blazix 1.2&nbsp; There are not that
many new and useful features in the latest JSP release, but some developers
may find the XML oriented features interesting.
<p><u><font size=+1>1.1</font></u>
<br><b><a href="Ion.html">ION</a>:</b>&nbsp; This is a new technology available
in Blazix, that makes it simple to do distributed processing.&nbsp; The
server and client agree upon a Java interface, the server registers an
object to implement the interface and the client looks up and uses the
interface.
<p><b><a href="Jms.html">JMS</a>:</b>&nbsp; Java Messaging Service.
<p><b><a href="Emailtags.html">E-mail</a>:</b>&nbsp; The JSP tag library
included in Blazix (BLX) now has support for email, including the ability
to send attachments.
<p><b><a href="ServerManager.html">Cluster Management</a>:</b>&nbsp; Now
a cluster of servers can all be easily remotely managed, with uploads,
log file access, configuration, startup and shutdown all available remotely.
<p><b><a href="Reload.html">Class Reloads</a>:</b>&nbsp; Blazix developers
have frequently asked for this, so now Blazix allows the ability to reload
Java classes without having to restart the server.&nbsp; This includes
full support for WAR file deployment and redeployment, but for development
purposes a simple URL is provided that may be entered in the browser, or
bookmarked.
<p><b><a href="EjbAdvanced.html#autokey">Automatic EJB Primary Keys:</a></b>&nbsp;
EJB primary keys can now be automatically generated, as an added convenience.
<p><b><a href="WebConfig.html">Virtual Hosting:</a></b>&nbsp; Blazix servers
can now be used for virtual hosting of multiple domain names at a single
IP address.&nbsp; See web-server configuration parameters for how to set
this up.
