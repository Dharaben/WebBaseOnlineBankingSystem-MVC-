<h2>
Cluster Administration in Blazix</h2>
The <a href="Tools.html#blxui">Blazix Server Administration tool</a> can&nbsp;
be used to remotely shutdown and start servers, view log files, view or
upload configurations, check status, and deploy or redeploy EJB Jars and
WEB archive (WAR) files.
<p>To take advantage of these facilities, the servers should be setup to
be managed by the Blazix Server Manager.&nbsp; The server manager runs
at each node in the cluster, and manages all Blazix servers (web servers,
EJB servers, JMS servers, cluster backup servers) at that node.&nbsp; Only
one copy of the server manager needs to be run at the node.
<p>On Windows systems (NT or 2000), the server manager can be started via
the provided Blazix Windows Service program.&nbsp; This program should
be configured and installed as a service.
<p>For non-Windows systems, the server manager should be started via the
machine startup sequence (the "RC" files in typical Unix systems.)&nbsp;
The command file (shell file or batch file) that does this should change
directory to the Blazix installation directory, it should then set the
classpath, and then it should invoke the server manager via the
<blockquote><tt>java desisoft.tools.ServerManager</tt></blockquote>
command.
<p>In both cases, Windows or other systems, a configuration file for the
server manager is required.&nbsp; In the case of Windows, the NT (or Windows
2000) service's ".ini" file also serves as the server manager's configuration
file, so a separate file does not need to be written -- instead the configuration
commands should be placed in the service's ".ini" file.
<p>On the machine from where the servers will be managed (i.e. from where
the <a href="Tools.html#blxui">Server Administration tool</a> will be run),
the cluster.ini file must contain configuration information for each Server
Manager on the cluster.
<p>For further details, see the <a href="Ntservice.html">Blazix Windows
Service</a> or the <a href="ServerManagerConfig.html">Server Manager configuration</a>.</td>
