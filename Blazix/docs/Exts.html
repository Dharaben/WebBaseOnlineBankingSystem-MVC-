<h3>
The .wsp and .xsp extensions</h3>
Blazix includes support for utilizing the JSP technology for WML and XML
files.
<p>The .wsp extension is enabled in Blazix to work similar to the .jsp
extension, but with the default mime-type of WML instead of HTML.
<p>Similarly, the .xsp extension provides the mime-type text/xml.
<p>Since XML is intended to provide machine-processable data, Blazix can
easily provide dynamically generated XML content to any user agents that
are seeking to accept XML.
<p>With WML, there is further Blazix support in the form of appropriate
forming of any error messages (such as exceptions.)
<p><b>Note about .wsp files:</b>&nbsp; In .wsp files, the page should not
be started with a JSP directive, but it should be started with the standard
<tt>&lt;?xml
</tt>syntax.&nbsp; This is because JSP directives on a line are replaced
by an empty line as per JSP specifications.&nbsp; Therefore if the <tt>&lt;?xml</tt>
is preceded by a line containing a JSP directive, it will not be the first
item in the file.
<p>JSP directives can be added after the first line.</td>
