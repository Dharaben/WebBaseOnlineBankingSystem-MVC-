<h2>
Clustering in Blazix</h2>
Blazix provides clustering support for Web servers, EJB servers, and JMS
servers.&nbsp;
<p>In all cases, Blazix clustering supports the use of multiple servers
to perform the task (load sharing) and providing support when a server
fails (fail-over).
<p>Blazix clustering is designed to avoid any single-point-of-failures.&nbsp;
For web-servers, shared filesystems used for saving session data can be
a single points of failure.&nbsp; Therefore Blazix provides the option
of using cluster-backup servers instead of a shared filesytem.&nbsp; As
long as at least two cluster-backup servers are operational, session data
will be backed up in two locations.
<p>For EJB servers and JMS servers, as well as for many Web operations,
the database may still be a single point of failure.&nbsp; This is outside
the scope of Blazix, and it is recommended that the database selected should
provide distributed fail-over support.
<p>Each type of clustering is explained in the sections below:
<p><a href="#web">Web Server Clustering</a>
<br><a href="#ejb">EJB Server Clustering</a>
<br><a href="#jms">JMS Server Clustering</a>
<p><a NAME="web"></a><b>Web Server Clustering</b>:&nbsp; For Web servers,
Blazix supports DNS based clustering.&nbsp; This requires an addtional
DNS based front-end load balancer, not included in Blazix.&nbsp; Such load
balancers are available from third party vendors.&nbsp; (Connector-based
load balancing is not included in Blazix.&nbsp; It was not clear what the
advantage of such a load-balancer would be in the context of Blazix.&nbsp;
Such a load-balancer has a single-point-of-failure and a single load-chokepoint,
which are against the goals of Blazix clustering.&nbsp; Nor are such load-balancers
very useful for load-handling, unless the application server is&nbsp; much
slower than the front-end server.&nbsp; Since the same term "load-balancer"
is used for this case as well, it could have misled Blazix users into thinking
they were getting something much more powerful than what they were actually
getting.&nbsp; To avoid such misrepresentation, the Desiderata Software
policy is that this feature is not included in the default installation
of Blazix.&nbsp; However, if any customers of a Blazix web-server enterprise
license would like a connector-based load balancer, it will be provided
by Desiderata Software at no extra charge.)
<p>Blazix is designed to work with two type of DNS front end load balancers.&nbsp;
In Blazix, these are called "<tt>smart</tt>" and "<tt>random</tt>".&nbsp;
A "<tt>smart</tt>" load balancer is one which is session-aware, and will
send the connections from the same client to the same server.&nbsp; A "<tt>random</tt>"
load balancer is not session-aware.&nbsp; Blazix will work with both types
of load balancers, but will optimize overhead if working with "<tt>smart</tt>"
load balancers.
<p>Blazix also offers two choices of backing up session data.&nbsp; Session
data can be backed up on a shared file server, or preferable (for efficiency
as well as for avoiding a single-point-of-failure) on the Blazix cluster-backup
servers.&nbsp; Cluster-backup servers store session data in memory and
provide it in the case of fail-over.
<p>To set up web-server clustering, create a cluster configuration file
and specify the names of your web-servers and cluster-backup servers in
it.&nbsp; The file must be identical at all servers.
<p><b>Important:</b>&nbsp; Web applications written for participation in
a cluster must ensure that all session data is serializable.&nbsp; Otherwise
the data will not be shareable and therefore cannot be backed up for clustering
purposes.
<p>When hot-deploying applications that are deployed on multiple servers
and that use session data, the uploads must be done using the "upload and
rescan" option, and all participating servers must be updated at once.&nbsp;
This allows the administration tool to gather all server ids from participating
servers and to redistribute all ids to all servers.&nbsp; This is neccessay
in order that sessions that have already been started, continue to see
the old version of the WAR file.
<p><a NAME="ejb"></a><b>EJB Server Clustering:</b>&nbsp; In Blazix, EJB
clustering is similar to Web clustering.&nbsp; But since EJB servers are
often used internally and may not have a DNS based load-balancer, Blazix
includes EJB "name servers".&nbsp; Any EJB server can be configured to
also act as a name server.&nbsp; The EJB clients see one or more name servers.&nbsp;
But the actual service may be provided by any EJB server registered with
the name servers, or even by the name servers themselves (because name
servers are not likely to be heavily loaded, they can also participate
in EJB servicing.)
<p>The EJB configuration file has options to specify that a particular
EJB server should act as a name server.&nbsp; If an EJB server is not a
name server, it should register itself with one or more name servers.
<p>When an&nbsp; EJB request comes in, the name server assigns it to one
of its registered EJB servers (that have the requested capability) in a
round-robin fashion.
<p>A failure during one single EJB connection is not automatically transferred
because of the risk involved.&nbsp; (E.g. if the failure occured before
a data item was written but the connection dropped before that fact could
be reported back, automatic transfer may cause the data item to be written
twice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the other direction, if success were reported before
actual data operation but the failure occurred right after the success
report, the data item may never get written.&nbsp; Therefore it was considered
unsafe to provide fully automatic fail-over in EJBs.)&nbsp; In EJBs, the
fail-over must be handled by the programmer, who has the option to involve
the end user or not, depending upon the operation.
<p>However, the next EJB connction will automatically be given to an available
and working server.
<p><a NAME="jms"></a><b>JMS Server Clustering:</b>&nbsp; Each JMS server
is identical in Blazix, and they all can act as an "entry point" to the
cluster.&nbsp; The JMS client should know the name of one or preferably
two JMS servers as the entry point servers.&nbsp; But once the JMS client
has access, it will be serviced by any of the servers in the cluster using
a least-used algorithm.&nbsp; If a server fails at any point during the
service, the fail-over will be entirely automatic, and the client will
receive the data as long as at least one server in the cluster continues
to operate.
<p>In the case of JMS - because of the much more controlled environment
- Blazix JMS servers can correctly handle all points of failure, therefore
there is no need for programmers or end users to be involved with the fail-over
mechanism.&nbsp; The load balancing as well as fail-over is fully automatic.
<p>To enable JMS clustering, simply add the JMS server names to the cluster
configuration files and start all servers.&nbsp; If new JMS servers are
added later on, they will be picked up by the cluster (via the shared database),
but for future operations the names should also be added to all the cluster
files.
