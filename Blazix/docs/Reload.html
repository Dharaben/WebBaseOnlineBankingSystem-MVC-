<h2>
Reloading classes in Blazix</h2>
EJB Jar files and Web archive (WAR) files can be uploaded dynamically in
Blazix, via the server administration interface.&nbsp; This is mostly for
production environments and clusters.
<p>For development, Blazix also provides a fast method to reload all classes
in a given Web application.&nbsp; This can be done by specifying the&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>application.&lt;name>.reloadUrl</tt></blockquote>
configuration parameter in the Web configuration file.
<p>The sample Web configuration file supplied with Blazix already sets
up the URL "<tt>/_reload"</tt> to be the reload URL for the "default" application.&nbsp;
(This should be taken out in production environments.)
<p>Visiting this URL (<tt>http://localhost/_reload</tt>) will drop all
existing user classes from the default application, and the next time they
are referenced, they will be reloaded.&nbsp; Therefore it can be used during
development to reload classes.&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; Any EJB Jar files in
the classpath that have been already loaded due to an EJB connection, cannot
be reloaded using this method.&nbsp; EJB Jar fils are loaded directly via
the system loader.)
<p>There is a small complication involved with this for JSP pages (and
servlets that use sessions.)&nbsp; Because all JSP pages use sessions by
default (unless the "<tt>session</tt>" parameter is set to false,) the
class reload will not appear to work.&nbsp; This is because as long as
a client request comes in with an old session object, Bazix must give it
the old set of classes to avoid changing classes in the middle of a client
session (to avoid generating errors from the mix-and-match of old and new
classes, the classes for any particular sessions are kept consistent.)
<p>A simple workaround for this is to exit the browser (close all browser
windows) and restart it.&nbsp; This will flush the session cookie, and
the next time you visit the JSP page in the browser, you will no longer
have a reference to an old session object.&nbsp; Therefore you will get
the new set of classes.
<p><b>Specifying classes for direct loading:</b>&nbsp; Some classes are
not designed for loading via a classloader, but should be loaded directly
by the system loader.&nbsp; These classes can be specified using the "<tt>useSystemLoader</tt>"
configuration parameter.&nbsp; These will not be reloadable, and will be
loaded directly using the system class loader.
